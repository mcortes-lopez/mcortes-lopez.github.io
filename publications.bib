              point when first signs of epitope loss appear to be detectable
              are not enlightened so far. By deep sequencing of the CD19 locus,
              we identified a blast-specific 2-nucleotide deletion in intron 2
              that exists in 35\% of B-ALL samples at initial diagnosis. This
              deletion overlaps with the binding site of RNA binding proteins

              Moreover, we could identify a number of other RBPs that are
              predicted to bind to the CD19 locus being deregulated in leukemic

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Circular RNAs (CircRNAs) are a newly appreciated
              class of RNAs that lack free 5' and 3' ends, are expressed by the
              thousands in diverse forms of life, and are mostly of enigmatic
              function. Ostensibly due to their resistance to exonucleases,
              circRNAs are known to be exceptionally stable. Previous work in
              Drosophila and mice have shown that circRNAs increase during
              aging in neural tissues. RESULTS: Here, we examined the global
              profile of circRNAs in C. elegans during aging by performing
              ribo-depleted total RNA-seq from the fourth larval stage (L4)
              through 10-day old adults. Using stringent bioinformatic criteria
              and experimental validation, we annotated a high-confidence set
              of 1166 circRNAs, including 575 newly discovered circRNAs. These
              circRNAs were derived from 797 genes with diverse functions,
              including genes involved in the determination of lifespan. A
              massive accumulation of circRNAs during aging was uncovered. Many
              hundreds of circRNAs were significantly increased among the aging
              time-points and increases of select circRNAs by over 40-fold
              during aging were quantified by RT-qPCR. The expression of 459
              circRNAs was determined to be distinct from the expression of
              linear RNAs from the same host genes, demonstrating host gene
              independence of circRNA age-accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: We
              attribute the global scale of circRNA age-accumulation to the
              high composition of post-mitotic cells in adult C. elegans,
              coupled with the high resistance of circRNAs to decay. These
              findings suggest that the exceptional stability of circRNAs might
              explain age-accumulation trends observed from neural tissues of
              other organisms, which also have a high composition of
              post-mitotic cells. Given the suitability of C. elegans for aging
              research, it is now poised as an excellent model system to
              determine whether there are functional consequences of circRNA
              accumulation during aging.",

              most commonly generated by back-splicing events from exons of
              protein-coding genes. This results in highly stable RNAs due to
              the lack of free 5' and 3' ends. CircRNAs are enriched in neural
              tissues, suggesting that they might have neural functions. Here,
              we sought to determine whether circRNA accumulation occurs during
              aging in mice. Total RNA-seq profiling of young (1 month old) and
              aged (22 month old) cortex, hippocampus and heart samples was
              performed. This led to the confident detection of 6,791 distinct
              circRNAs across these samples, including 675 novel circRNAs.
              Analysis uncovered a strong bias for circRNA upregulation during
              aging in neural tissues. These age-accumulation trends were
              verified for individual circRNAs by RT-qPCR and Northern
              analysis. In contrast, comparison of aged versus young hearts
              failed to reveal a global trend for circRNA upregulation.
              Age-accumulation of circRNAs in brain tissues was found to be
              largely independent from linear RNA expression of host genes.
              These findings suggest that circRNAs might play biological roles
              relevant to the aging nervous system.",

  abstract = {Stem cells regulate their self-renewal and differentiation fate outcomes through both symmetric and asymmetric divisions. m6A RNA methylation controls symmetric commitment and inflammation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) through unknown mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that the nuclear speckle protein SON is an essential m6A target required for murine HSC self-renewal, symmetric commitment, and inflammation control. Global profiling of m6A identified that m6A mRNA methylation of Son increases during HSC commitment. Upon m6A depletion, Son mRNA increases, but its protein is depleted. Reintroduction of SON rescues defects in HSC symmetric commitment divisions and engraftment. Conversely, Son deletion results in a loss of HSC fitness, while overexpression of SON improves mouse and human HSC engraftment potential by increasing quiescence. Mechanistically, we found that SON rescues MYC and suppresses the METTL3-HSC inflammatory gene expression program, including CCL5, through transcriptional regulation. Thus, our findings define a m6A-SON-CCL5 axis that controls inflammation and HSC fate.},
