abstract: Neuromuscular junction degeneration is a prominent aspect of sarcopenia,
  the age-associated loss of skeletal muscle integrity. Previously, we showed that
  muscle stem cells activate and contribute to mouse neuromuscular junction regeneration
  in response to denervation (Liu et al., 2015). Here, we examined gene expression
  profiles and neuromuscular junction integrity in aged mouse muscles, and unexpectedly
  found limited denervation despite a high level of degenerated neuromuscular junctions.
  Instead, degenerated neuromuscular junctions were associated with reduced contribution
  from muscle stem cells. Indeed, muscle stem cell depletion was sufficient to induce
  neuromuscular junction degeneration at a younger age. Conversely, prevention of
  muscle stem cell and derived myonuclei loss was associated with attenuation of age-related
  neuromuscular junction degeneration, muscle atrophy, and the promotion of aged muscle
  force generation. Our observations demonstrate that deficiencies in muscle stem
  cell fate and post-synaptic myogenesis provide a cellular basis for age-related
  neuromuscular junction degeneration and associated skeletal muscle decline.
