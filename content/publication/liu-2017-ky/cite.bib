 abstract = {Neuromuscular junction degeneration is a prominent aspect of
sarcopenia, the age-associated loss of skeletal muscle integrity.
Previously, we showed that muscle stem cells activate and
contribute to mouse neuromuscular junction regeneration in
response to denervation (Liu et al., 2015). Here, we examined
gene expression profiles and neuromuscular junction integrity in
aged mouse muscles, and unexpectedly found limited denervation
despite a high level of degenerated neuromuscular junctions.
Instead, degenerated neuromuscular junctions were associated with
reduced contribution from muscle stem cells. Indeed, muscle stem
cell depletion was sufficient to induce neuromuscular junction
degeneration at a younger age. Conversely, prevention of muscle
stem cell and derived myonuclei loss was associated with
attenuation of age-related neuromuscular junction degeneration,
muscle atrophy, and the promotion of aged muscle force
generation. Our observations demonstrate that deficiencies in
muscle stem cell fate and post-synaptic myogenesis provide a
cellular basis for age-related neuromuscular junction
degeneration and associated skeletal muscle decline.},
