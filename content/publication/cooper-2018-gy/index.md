abstract: The genome-wide expression patterns of circular RNAs (circRNAs) are of increasing
  interest for their potential roles in normal cellular homeostasis, development,
  and disease. Thousands of circRNAs have been annotated from various species in recent
  years. Analysis of publically available or user-generated rRNA-depleted total RNA-seq
  data can be performed to uncover new circRNA expression trends. Here we provide
  a primer for profiling circRNAs from RNA-seq datasets. The description is tailored
  for the wet lab scientist with limited or no experience in analyzing RNA-seq data.
  We begin by describing how to access and interpret circRNA annotations. Next, we
  cover converting circRNA annotations into junction sequences that are used as scaffolds
  to align RNA-seq reads. Lastly, we visit quantifying circRNA expression trends from
  the alignment data.
