 abstract = {The genome-wide expression patterns of circular RNAs (circRNAs)
are of increasing interest for their potential roles in normal
cellular homeostasis, development, and disease. Thousands of
circRNAs have been annotated from various species in recent
years. Analysis of publically available or user-generated
rRNA-depleted total RNA-seq data can be performed to uncover new
circRNA expression trends. Here we provide a primer for profiling
circRNAs from RNA-seq datasets. The description is tailored for
the wet lab scientist with limited or no experience in analyzing
RNA-seq data. We begin by describing how to access and interpret
circRNA annotations. Next, we cover converting circRNA
annotations into junction sequences that are used as scaffolds to
align RNA-seq reads. Lastly, we visit quantifying circRNA
expression trends from the alignment data.},
