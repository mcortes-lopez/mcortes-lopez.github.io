abstract: Stem cells regulate their self-renewal and differentiation fate outcomes
  through both symmetric and asymmetric divisions. m6A RNA methylation controls symmetric
  commitment and inflammation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) through unknown mechanisms.
  Here, we demonstrate that the nuclear speckle protein SON is an essential m6A target
  required for murine HSC self-renewal, symmetric commitment, and inflammation control.
  Global profiling of m6A identified that m6A mRNA methylation of Son increases during
  HSC commitment. Upon m6A depletion, Son mRNA increases, but its protein is depleted.
  Reintroduction of SON rescues defects in HSC symmetric commitment divisions and
  engraftment. Conversely, Son deletion results in a loss of HSC fitness, while overexpression
  of SON improves mouse and human HSC engraftment potential by increasing quiescence.
  Mechanistically, we found that SON rescues MYC and suppresses the METTL3-HSC inflammatory
  gene expression program, including CCL5, through transcriptional regulation. Thus,
  our findings define a m6A-SON-CCL5 axis that controls inflammation and HSC fate.
