 abstract = {Following CART-19 immunotherapy for B-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukaemia (B-ALL), many patients relapse due to loss of the
cognate CD19 epitope. Since epitope loss can be caused by
aberrant CD19 exon 2 processing, we herein investigate the
regulatory code that controls CD19 splicing. We combine
high-throughput mutagenesis with mathematical modelling to
quantitatively disentangle the effects of all mutations in the
region comprising CD19 exons 1-3. Thereupon, we identify ~200
single point mutations that alter CD19 splicing and thus could
predispose B-ALL patients to developing CART-19 resistance.
Furthermore, we report almost 100 previously unknown splice
isoforms that emerge from cryptic splice sites and likely encode
non-functional CD19 proteins. We further identify cis-regulatory
elements and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins that control CD19
splicing (e.g., PTBP1 and SF3B4) and validate that loss of these
factors leads to pervasive CD19 mis-splicing. Our dataset
represents a comprehensive resource for identifying predictive
biomarkers for CART-19 therapy.},
