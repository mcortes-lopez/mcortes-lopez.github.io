abstract: Following CART-19 immunotherapy for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
  (B-ALL), many patients relapse due to loss of the cognate CD19 epitope. Since epitope
  loss can be caused by aberrant CD19 exon 2 processing, we herein investigate the
  regulatory code that controls CD19 splicing. We combine high-throughput mutagenesis
  with mathematical modelling to quantitatively disentangle the effects of all mutations
  in the region comprising CD19 exons 1-3. Thereupon, we identify ~200 single point
  mutations that alter CD19 splicing and thus could predispose B-ALL patients to developing
  CART-19 resistance. Furthermore, we report almost 100 previously unknown splice
  isoforms that emerge from cryptic splice sites and likely encode non-functional
  CD19 proteins. We further identify cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting RNA-binding
  proteins that control CD19 splicing (e.g., PTBP1 and SF3B4) and validate that loss
  of these factors leads to pervasive CD19 mis-splicing. Our dataset represents a
  comprehensive resource for identifying predictive biomarkers for CART-19 therapy.
