abstract: "BACKGROUND: Circular RNAs (CircRNAs) are a newly appreciated class of RNAs
  that lack free 5' and 3' ends, are expressed by the thousands in diverse forms of
  life, and are mostly of enigmatic function. Ostensibly due to their resistance to
  exonucleases, circRNAs are known to be exceptionally stable. Previous work in Drosophila
  and mice have shown that circRNAs increase during aging in neural tissues. RESULTS:
  Here, we examined the global profile of circRNAs in C. elegans during aging by performing
  ribo-depleted total RNA-seq from the fourth larval stage (L4) through 10-day old
  adults. Using stringent bioinformatic criteria and experimental validation, we annotated
  a high-confidence set of 1166 circRNAs, including 575 newly discovered circRNAs.
  These circRNAs were derived from 797 genes with diverse functions, including genes
  involved in the determination of lifespan. A massive accumulation of circRNAs during
  aging was uncovered. Many hundreds of circRNAs were significantly increased among
  the aging time-points and increases of select circRNAs by over 40-fold during aging
  were quantified by RT-qPCR. The expression of 459 circRNAs was determined to be
  distinct from the expression of linear RNAs from the same host genes, demonstrating
  host gene independence of circRNA age-accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: We attribute the
  global scale of circRNA age-accumulation to the high composition of post-mitotic
  cells in adult C. elegans, coupled with the high resistance of circRNAs to decay.
  These findings suggest that the exceptional stability of circRNAs might explain
  age-accumulation trends observed from neural tissues of other organisms, which also
  have a high composition of post-mitotic cells. Given the suitability of C. elegans
  for aging research, it is now poised as an excellent model system to determine whether
  there are functional consequences of circRNA accumulation during aging."
