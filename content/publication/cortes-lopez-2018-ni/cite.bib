 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circular RNAs (CircRNAs) are a newly appreciated
class of RNAs that lack free 5' and 3' ends, are expressed by the
thousands in diverse forms of life, and are mostly of enigmatic
function. Ostensibly due to their resistance to exonucleases,
circRNAs are known to be exceptionally stable. Previous work in
Drosophila and mice have shown that circRNAs increase during
aging in neural tissues. RESULTS: Here, we examined the global
profile of circRNAs in C. elegans during aging by performing
ribo-depleted total RNA-seq from the fourth larval stage (L4)
through 10-day old adults. Using stringent bioinformatic criteria
and experimental validation, we annotated a high-confidence set
of 1166 circRNAs, including 575 newly discovered circRNAs. These
circRNAs were derived from 797 genes with diverse functions,
including genes involved in the determination of lifespan. A
massive accumulation of circRNAs during aging was uncovered. Many
hundreds of circRNAs were significantly increased among the aging
time-points and increases of select circRNAs by over 40-fold
during aging were quantified by RT-qPCR. The expression of 459
circRNAs was determined to be distinct from the expression of
linear RNAs from the same host genes, demonstrating host gene
independence of circRNA age-accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: We
attribute the global scale of circRNA age-accumulation to the
high composition of post-mitotic cells in adult C. elegans,
coupled with the high resistance of circRNAs to decay. These
findings suggest that the exceptional stability of circRNAs might
explain age-accumulation trends observed from neural tissues of
other organisms, which also have a high composition of
post-mitotic cells. Given the suitability of C. elegans for aging
research, it is now poised as an excellent model system to
determine whether there are functional consequences of circRNA
accumulation during aging.},
