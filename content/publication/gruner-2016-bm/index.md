abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a newly appreciated class of RNAs expressed
  across diverse phyla. These enigmatic transcripts are most commonly generated by
  back-splicing events from exons of protein-coding genes. This results in highly
  stable RNAs due to the lack of free 5' and 3' ends. CircRNAs are enriched in neural
  tissues, suggesting that they might have neural functions. Here, we sought to determine
  whether circRNA accumulation occurs during aging in mice. Total RNA-seq profiling
  of young (1 month old) and aged (22 month old) cortex, hippocampus and heart samples
  was performed. This led to the confident detection of 6,791 distinct circRNAs across
  these samples, including 675 novel circRNAs. Analysis uncovered a strong bias for
  circRNA upregulation during aging in neural tissues. These age-accumulation trends
  were verified for individual circRNAs by RT-qPCR and Northern analysis. In contrast,
  comparison of aged versus young hearts failed to reveal a global trend for circRNA
  upregulation. Age-accumulation of circRNAs in brain tissues was found to be largely
  independent from linear RNA expression of host genes. These findings suggest that
  circRNAs might play biological roles relevant to the aging nervous system.
