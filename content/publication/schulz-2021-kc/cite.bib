 abstract = {Resistance to CD19-directed immunotherapies in lymphoblastic
leukemia has been attributed, among other factors, to several
aberrant CD19 pre-mRNA splicing events, including recently
reported excision of a cryptic intron embedded within CD19 exon
2. While ``exitrons'' are known to exist in hundreds of human
transcripts, we discovered, using reporter assays and direct
long-read RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq), that the CD19 exitron is an
artifact of reverse transcription. Extending our analysis to
publicly available datasets, we identified dozens of
questionable exitrons, dubbed ``falsitrons,'' that appear only
in cDNA-seq, but never in dRNA-seq. Our results highlight the
importance of dRNA-seq for transcript isoform validation.},
