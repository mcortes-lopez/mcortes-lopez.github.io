abstract: Resistance to CD19-directed immunotherapies in lymphoblastic leukemia has
  been attributed, among other factors, to several aberrant CD19 pre-mRNA splicing
  events, including recently reported excision of a cryptic intron embedded within
  CD19 exon 2. While ``exitrons'' are known to exist in hundreds of human transcripts,
  we discovered, using reporter assays and direct long-read RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq),
  that the CD19 exitron is an artifact of reverse transcription. Extending our analysis
  to publicly available datasets, we identified dozens of questionable exitrons, dubbed
  ``falsitrons,'' that appear only in cDNA-seq, but never in dRNA-seq. Our results
  highlight the importance of dRNA-seq for transcript isoform validation.
