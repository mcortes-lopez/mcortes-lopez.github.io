abstract: Despite massive improvements in the treatment of B-ALL through CART-19 immunotherapy,
  a large number of patients suffer a relapse due to loss of the targeted epitope.
  Mutations in the CD19 locus and aberrant splicing events are known to account for
  the absence of surface antigen. However, early molecular determinants suggesting
  therapy resistance as well as the time point when first signs of epitope loss appear
  to be detectable are not enlightened so far. By deep sequencing of the CD19 locus,
  we identified a blast-specific 2-nucleotide deletion in intron 2 that exists in
  35% of B-ALL samples at initial diagnosis. This deletion overlaps with the binding
  site of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) including PTBP1 and might thereby affect CD19
  splicing. Moreover, we could identify a number of other RBPs that are predicted
  to bind to the CD19 locus being deregulated in leukemic blasts, including NONO.
  Their expression is highly heterogeneous across B-ALL molecular subtypes as shown
  by analyzing 706 B-ALL samples accessed via the St. Jude Cloud. Mechanistically,
  we show that downregulation of PTBP1, but not of NONO, in 697 cells reduces CD19
  total protein by increasing intron 2 retention. Isoform analysis in patient samples
  revealed that blasts, at diagnosis, express increased amounts of CD19 intron 2 retention
  compared to normal B cells. Our data suggest that loss of RBP functionality by mutations
  altering their binding motifs or by deregulated expression might harbor the potential
  for the disease-associated accumulation of therapy-resistant CD19 isoforms.
