abstract: Mutations causing aberrant splicing are frequently implicated in human diseases
  including cancer. Here, we establish a high-throughput screen of randomly mutated
  minigenes to decode the cis-regulatory landscape that determines alternative splicing
  of exon 11 in the proto-oncogene MST1R (RON). Mathematical modelling of splicing
  kinetics enables us to identify more than 1000 mutations affecting RON exon 11 skipping,
  which corresponds to the pathological isoform RON∆165. Importantly, the effects
  correlate with RON alternative splicing in cancer patients bearing the same mutations.
  Moreover, we highlight heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (HNRNPH) as a key
  regulator of RON splicing in healthy tissues and cancer. Using iCLIP and synergy
  analysis, we pinpoint the functionally most relevant HNRNPH binding sites and demonstrate
  how cooperative HNRNPH binding facilitates a splicing switch of RON exon 11. Our
  results thereby offer insights into splicing regulation and the impact of mutations
  on alternative splicing in cancer.
