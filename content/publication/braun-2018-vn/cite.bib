 abstract = {Mutations causing aberrant splicing are frequently implicated in
human diseases including cancer. Here, we establish a
high-throughput screen of randomly mutated minigenes to decode
the cis-regulatory landscape that determines alternative
splicing of exon 11 in the proto-oncogene MST1R (RON).
Mathematical modelling of splicing kinetics enables us to
identify more than 1000 mutations affecting RON exon 11
skipping, which corresponds to the pathological isoform RON∆165.
Importantly, the effects correlate with RON alternative splicing
in cancer patients bearing the same mutations. Moreover, we
highlight heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (HNRNPH) as
a key regulator of RON splicing in healthy tissues and cancer.
Using iCLIP and synergy analysis, we pinpoint the functionally
most relevant HNRNPH binding sites and demonstrate how
cooperative HNRNPH binding facilitates a splicing switch of RON
exon 11. Our results thereby offer insights into splicing
regulation and the impact of mutations on alternative splicing
in cancer.},
