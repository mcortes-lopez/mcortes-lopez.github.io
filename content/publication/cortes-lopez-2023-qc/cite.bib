 abstract = {RNA splicing factors are recurrently mutated in clonal blood
disorders, but the impact of dysregulated splicing in
hematopoiesis remains unclear. To overcome technical
limitations, we integrated genotyping of transcriptomes (GoT)
with long-read single-cell transcriptomics and proteogenomics
for single-cell profiling of transcriptomes, surface proteins,
somatic mutations, and RNA splicing (GoT-Splice). We applied
GoT-Splice to hematopoietic progenitors from myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS) patients with mutations in the core splicing
factor SF3B1. SF3B1mut cells were enriched in the
megakaryocytic-erythroid lineage, with expansion of SF3B1mut
erythroid progenitor cells. We uncovered distinct cryptic 3'
splice site usage in different progenitor populations and
stage-specific aberrant splicing during erythroid
differentiation. Profiling SF3B1-mutated clonal hematopoiesis
samples revealed that erythroid bias and cell-type-specific
cryptic 3' splice site usage in SF3B1mut cells precede overt
MDS. Collectively, GoT-Splice defines the cell-type-specific
impact of somatic mutations on RNA splicing, from early clonal
outgrowths to overt neoplasia, directly in human samples.},
