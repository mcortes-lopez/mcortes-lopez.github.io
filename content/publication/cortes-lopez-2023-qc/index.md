abstract: RNA splicing factors are recurrently mutated in clonal blood disorders,
  but the impact of dysregulated splicing in hematopoiesis remains unclear. To overcome
  technical limitations, we integrated genotyping of transcriptomes (GoT) with long-read
  single-cell transcriptomics and proteogenomics for single-cell profiling of transcriptomes,
  surface proteins, somatic mutations, and RNA splicing (GoT-Splice). We applied GoT-Splice
  to hematopoietic progenitors from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with mutations
  in the core splicing factor SF3B1. SF3B1mut cells were enriched in the megakaryocytic-erythroid
  lineage, with expansion of SF3B1mut erythroid progenitor cells. We uncovered distinct
  cryptic 3' splice site usage in different progenitor populations and stage-specific
  aberrant splicing during erythroid differentiation. Profiling SF3B1-mutated clonal
  hematopoiesis samples revealed that erythroid bias and cell-type-specific cryptic
  3' splice site usage in SF3B1mut cells precede overt MDS. Collectively, GoT-Splice
  defines the cell-type-specific impact of somatic mutations on RNA splicing, from
  early clonal outgrowths to overt neoplasia, directly in human samples.
