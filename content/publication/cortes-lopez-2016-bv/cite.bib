 abstract = {Many thousands of Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have recently been
identified in metazoan genomes by transcriptome-wide sequencing.
Most circRNAs are generated by back-splicing events from exons of
protein-coding genes. A great deal of progress has recently been
made in understanding the genome-wide expression patterns,
biogenesis, and regulation of circRNAs. To date, however, few
functions of circRNAs have been identified. CircRNAs are
preferentially expressed in neural tissues and some are found at
synapses, suggesting possible functions in the nervous system.
Several circRNAs have been shown to function as microRNA
``sponges'' to counteract microRNA mediated repression of mRNA.
New functions for circRNAs are arising, including protein
sequestration, transcriptional regulation, and potential
functions in cancer. Here, we highlight the recent progress made
in understanding the biogenesis and regulation of circRNAs,
discuss newly uncovered circRNA functions, and explain the
methodological approaches that could reveal more exciting and
unexpected roles for these RNAs.},
